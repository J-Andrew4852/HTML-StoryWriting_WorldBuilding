            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Arcane is an animated series based on the "League of Legends" universe. It excels in world-building by introducing the thriving city of Piltover and the grim undercity of Zaun. Piltover and Zaun are contrasted throughout the series through their stunning visuals, governing structures and character stories.</p>

            <h3>Contrasting Astmospheres</h3>
            <p>While it is clear that the hopeful story of Piltover and the tragic story of Zaun are contrasted in many ways. I am impressed by the attention to detail that Acrane has that shows the difference in the atmospheres of the cities, which is done through soundtracks, stylistic animation, background detail and character disposition shifts between environments.</p>
