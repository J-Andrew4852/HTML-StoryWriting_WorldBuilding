            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Borderlands, a renowned video game series, showcases world-building through its diverse and visually striking planet Pandora, rich lore, and memorable characters. The unique art style, humor, and immersive environments contribute to creating a captivating yet gritty world, making it a narrative-driven game which focuses around diverse gunplay within the looter shooter genre.</p>

            <h3>Using World Building as a Tool</h3>
            <p>Borderlands uses worldbuilding as a tool for fun, it creates insane characters and wild environments that engage and enhance its chaotic gameplay. Borderlands 2 is a standout for me as not only does its main story stand above the rest, but the sidequests are fastpace and entertaining.</p>
