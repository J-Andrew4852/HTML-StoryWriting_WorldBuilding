        <p>Creative writing has recently become an enjoyable hobby of mine, particularly in the realm of world-building. This website will showcase some of my favourite games, shows, and books which excel in world building. These narratives have made to look at world building different ways within my creative writing. Due to the different mediums of these stories, they show the world to the viewer / reader in unique ways whether it be through stylistic gameplay, attention to animation or having a reader follow the story through a characters voice. These worlds and the stories within them have inspired and given me many new ideas within the own worlds I create through my creative writing.</p>
