            <p>
                Hi, I'm James. I recently graduated from Curtin University. I am a Web Designer / Developer, located in Perth Australia.
                During my time at Curtin University, I took a couple classes in creative writing and I have taken up writing as a hobby ever since.
                <br><br>
                I created a website to help myself and others write stories, build out their worlds and create characters.
                I am looking to completely rework the website, as I am much more skilled and experienced as coding than when I created the website originally.
